		<p>We are an anti-drone proliferation advocacy organization based out of Moscow, Idaho.</p>

		<p> We agree with the Council on Foreign Relations that armed drone proliferation must be immediately limited for the following reasons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>they further distance us from the consequences of war</li>
				<li>we lack the ability to effectively track them</li>
				<li>our experience thus far has yielded exponentially more civilian casualities but not demonstrably increased security</li>
			</ul></p>
